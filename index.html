                        <p>Kazi Nazrul Islam is the national poet of Bangladesh who is especially recognized as a Bidrohi Kobi
                            (rebel poet) around the country. Nazrul is a famous poet, musician and philosopher of Bangladesh.
                            The famous poet Nazrulâ€™s writings deal with the revolution of that period of the British government.
                            His revolutionary attempt helped him to be a national poet of Bangladesh. He has raised his voice
                            against any kinds of fascism and oppression and got popularity swiftly around the Indian Subcontinent.</p>
                        <h3 class="ui header">Awesome Writer</h3>
                        <p>Nazrul's writings explored themes such as love, freedom, humanity, and revolution. He opposed all
                            forms of bigotry and fundamentalism, including religious, caste-based and gender-based. Throughout
                            his career, Nazrul wrote short stories, novels, and essays but is best known for his songs and
                            poems. He pioneered new music forms such as Bengali ghazals. Nazrul wrote and composed music
                            for nearly 4,000 songs (many recorded on HMV and gramophone records), collectively known as Nazrul
                            Geeti.
